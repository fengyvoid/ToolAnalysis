# EBSaver

EBSaver is a part of Event Building version 2 tool chain.
For reference slides, see:

For a group of trigger with it's main trigger in part file x, that event will be saved as processed file x.
There shouldn't be any error if the file is correctly processed, the stat info will be printed out at Finalise. 
Processing one part file usually just take a few minutes. The time of processing multiple files will be increased quick because of the trigger grouping. There is a limit but more than 7 beam files are not recommended.
